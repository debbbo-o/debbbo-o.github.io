            <p>Pears, are a typical from from temperate climates, have a delicate, smooth and pleasant taste. It is very
                commonly found in many countries as the fifth most widely produced fruit in the world, being produced
                mainly in China, Europe, and the United States. It appears in many different cuisines and dishes, from
                salads to desserts (eg. pies, jams, ice cream) and is even great when being paired with various meats
                (eg. lamb or bacon).

                    <h3>Origin of pears</h3>
                    <p>
                        The name 'pear' is derived from the Latin word, <i>pira</i>, which means "fruit".
                        <br>
                        Pears have two different origin and domestication points, China and Asia Minor until the Middle
                        East.
                        Pears are one of the oldest cultivated and beloved fruits in the world, dating back to 5000 BC and
                        have
                        been grown in China from as early as 2000 BC.
                        <br>
                        Historians say that 7,000 years ago, in the foothills of Tien Shan, a Chinese diplomat became
                        obsessed
                        with pears. His fascination with the sweet fruit led him to abandon his career and begin a business
                        of
                        grafting and selling pear trees.

            <h2>Types of Pears</h2>
            <p>
                There are more than approximately 3000 pear varieties grown worldwide. There are different types of
                pears grown in different regions all have varying characteristics like appearance, softness and
                sweetness.
                <br>
                Asian pears are native to Japan and China where they have been grown for over 3000 years. Chinese pears
                are called "LÃ­" and are round with smooth, yellow skin while the Japanese pears are called "Nashi" which
                has a longer and more oblong shape with thin brown skin.
            <br>
            <br>

                    The Hosui pear has a snappy and tangy taste with a slightly higher acid content than other Asian
                    pears. It
                    is really sweet and crisp, similar to an apple, and has really high water content.

                    <h2>Nutritional Value of Pears</h2>

                    <p>
                        Pears are an exceptional source of natural nutrients from different essential vitamins to dietary fibre.
                        It is only 100 calories for a medium sized pear which packs 21% daily value for dietary fibre, 8%
                        Vitamin C and 4% potassium.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Dietary Fibre</b>
                        <br>
                        Pears are one of the best fruits to consume because of its high value of dietary fibre. Fibre helps to
                        maintain balance, regularity and reduces the risk of colorectal cancer. It slows digestion in the upper
                        gastrointestinal track which helps to prolong the feeling of fullness and also slows absorption of
                        sugars which reduces sugar spikes and cravings.

                        <b>Potassium</b>
                        <br>
                        Potassium is important as it is necessary for muscle contractions, including a regular heartbeat, and
                        nerve impulses which helps with reflexes. It also helps regulate fluid balance by osmosis within cells.
                        Poor fuild balance can lead to dehydration which in turn, can affect the heart and kidneys.

                        <b>Vitamin C</b>
                        <br>
                        Vitamin C, which is also known as ascorbic acid, is essential for the growth, development and repair of
                        all the body tissues. It is involved in many body functions, such as the formation of collagen,
                        absorption of iron, proper functioning of the immune system, wound healing, and maintaenance of
                        cartilage, bones and even teeth.

                    <h3>Germination</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each mature fruit contains up to ten sleek, black seeds covered with a thin endosperm coating. The tough
                        seed coat holds the embryo, endosperm, cotyledons, as well as the young root and shoot. 
    
                        Pear seeds usually begin to sprout and produce green leaves within 3 months, but some sprouts may emerge as early as 18
                        days after planting.
    
                        Germination starts when the seed coat absorbs water, causing it to expand and crack open.
                        The first sign of life is the radicle, a small white tail that grows into the plant's primary root. The
                        radicle's purpose is to anchor the plant securely in the soil and initiate water absorption. 
                        As the seed absorbs water, a stem emerges, and the cotyledons start to unfurl. These cotyledons are the initial leaves
                        of the seedlings.
                        True leaves, similar to those of a fully grown pear tree, appear several days later.
                        Once the seedlings have at least four true leaves, they are ready for transplantation.

                    <h3>Juvenile</h3>
                    <p>
                        During the early phase of growth, a pear seedling remains in its vegetative stage, and it typically
                        takes at
                        least four years before the tree starts producing blooms. Sometimes, this blooming process can take as
                        long
                        as 14 years.

                        Young pear trees grow vertically, sporting dense foliage that may resemble thorny plants. Initially, the
                        bark is smooth, but as the tree matures, it becomes tougher. Meanwhile, the roots also experience rapid
                        growth.

                        Pear leaves are glossy and dark green, featuring lighter green veins that extend from the leaf center to
                        its
                        edges. The undersides of the leaves have a non-shiny texture and a lighter hue.

                        As the pear tree reaches maturity, its leaves take on a teardrop shape with sharp edges and a rounded
                        base.
                        The leaf edges are slightly serrated. The bark of the mature pear tree appears grey-brown, but over
                        time, it
                        transforms into a scaly texture.

                        Pear flowers appear as small, closed green buds with an oval to rectangular shape on the tree's dark
                        brown
                        branches. When the spring temperatures rise, these buds open up, revealing broad, flat, and velvety

                        Usually, pear blossoms grow in groups of five to seven and emit a pleasant and fresh fragrance. Bees
                        play a
                        crucial role in pollination by transferring pollen between different pear varieties, aiding in the
                        optimal
                        development of fruits.

                        Although pear flowers bloom for a brief period and offer limited nectar to bees, bees remain the main
                        pollinators. Additional pollinators may be necessary for pear trees to yield fruits successfully.

                        Insufficient pollination can lead to early fruit shedding, and the fruits that do grow might be small
                        and
                        misshapen. Conversely, with proper pollination, the outcome is the production of large and well-formed
                        pears.

                    <h3>Fruiting</h3>
                    <p>
                        After successful pollination, a cluster of five to eight fruits forms, surrounded by leaves. It takes
                        approximately 115 to 165 days, or three to five months, from full bloom to harvest.

                        The majority of the fruit is made up of the base of the floral tube, the pseudocarp, and the floret
                        receptacles. Fruit size is influenced by crucial processes like cell division and expansion. During the
                        cell
                        expansion stage, the cells absorb abundant water, leading to a rapid increase in fruit size.

                        When fully mature, the pear fruit has an elongated shape, narrow at the stem end, and wider at the
                        opposite
                        end. Pears come in various colors, including green, red, yellow, gold, and brown varieties.

                    <p>
                        As the days shorten and temperatures decrease, the pear tree naturally pauses its growth as part of its
                        annual cycle. During this time, the tree sheds its leaves and enters a period of dormancy or rest.

                        When the weather warms up again, the bud initiation process starts anew, marking the beginning of a new
                        cycle of blooming and fruiting. Typically, pear trees bloom from late February to mid-April, and the
                        fruit
                        is produced from mid-August to mid-October. With favorable conditions, pear trees have the potential to
                        live
                        for around 50 years.
